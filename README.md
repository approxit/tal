# Tales and Legends
It's a Dark Fantasy RPG system born in a [PBF game](http://www.tal.webd.pl) which you will probably find confounding because it's entirely written in Polish.
But... it uses CSS Paged Media with [paged.js](https://www.pagedjs.org/).

## Building
First of all, you need install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to prepare code to build. Then run following commands:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run corebook
    
Final PDF files can be found in `bin` directory.
