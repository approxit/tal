# Tales and Legends

It's a Dark Fantasy RPG system born in a [PBF game](http://www.tal.webd.pl) which you will probably find confounding because it's entirely written in Polish.
This repository contains its rule books source and additional stuff used along side.  

## Building books

First of all, books use CSS Paged Media with [paged.js](https://www.pagedjs.org/).

To compile it by yourself, you need install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Then run following commands:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run corebook

Final PDF files can be found in `books/build` directory.

## License

The books content itself are under the Copyright license, and other underlying source code used to format and display that content, etc. is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
